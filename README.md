# Clustering Algorithm

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a clustering algorithm. The notebook demonstrates clustering techniques using data analysis and visualization methods.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation of clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Evaluation of clustering performance
- Graphical representation of clusters

## Installation
To run the notebook, ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clustering-algorithm.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd clustering-algorithm
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `Clustering_Algorithm1.ipynb` and execute the cells sequentially.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The notebook visualizes clusters and evaluates the effectiveness of different clustering methods. Example outputs include scatter plots and cluster labels.
